### Hello 👋 I'm Sophie!

🌟 I'm a quantitative epidemiologist at [Epicentre](https://epicentre.msf.org/en), Médecins Sans Frontières.

* 👩‍💻 I'm interested in developing and/or applying mathematical and statistical methods to support response to infectious disease outbreaks, primarily in humanitarian settings. I'm currently working on projects on cholera and Ebola virus disease, and I also worked on the COVID-19 pandemic.
* ⚙️ R user, and dabbling occasionally in Stan. I'm an R instructor with the nonprofit [Applied Epi](https://appliedepi.org/).
    * 📦 I recently co-developed an R package [{pepbp}](https://sophiemeakin.github.io/pepbp/) to simulate an infectious disease outbreak with post-exposure prophylaxis for high-risk contacts.
* 🇫🇷 Based in Paris, France.
* ⬅️ Previously a Research Fellow in real-time modelling of infectious disease outbreaks at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (UK), and a consultant with the World Health Organisation (Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo).
* 🎓 PhD in applied mathematics from the University of Warwick.
